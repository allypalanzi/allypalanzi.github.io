How would you save Earth from a deadly asteroid? On October 23rd, we posed that very question to five brave designers in a series of four timed challenges during Vox Media's first ever Pixel Punch. Over 100 attendees came to watch Victor Ware, Joseph Le, Josh Mahan, Danielle Theroux and Peter Verastegui save our planet from destruction by way of their best design skills while being judged by leading local and industry talent â€” Jason Santa Maria, Carolyn Sewell, Nicki Dlugash, and Terry Biddle.
