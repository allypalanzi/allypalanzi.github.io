I'm not going to lie, at first I didn't want to write this. After looking at my [2015](/year-in-review-2015.html) review, I realized that I had done barely anything from the goals I set for myself. Instead of focusing my efforts on the tech-related things I aspired in 2015, in 2016 I focused on my relationships, self-care, reflection, and my health â€“ things that I've found are way more important to me than tech.

**Tech / Community:**
