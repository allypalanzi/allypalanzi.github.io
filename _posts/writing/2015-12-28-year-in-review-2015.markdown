After graduating from college in mid 2014, I felt pretty burnt out on working on my own things from four years of craziness and not sleeping normally. Finally, I was relived to have a steady job, schedule, and income. I spent the end of 2014 adjusting to my new life which left me ready to take on 2015 with a sense of stability and ambition. I spent the year focusing mostly on myself and my career. I think it was a pretty good fucking year and here are some things that I did:

- Continued to run a [meetup](http://sassydc.github.io/) (though we’re on a bit of a hiatus, shh)
- Taught my first ever [workshop](http://product.voxmedia.com/2015/3/9/8162607/femsplain-html-css-workshop)
- Taught a class at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/ally-palanzi/4262)
- Named one of [DC’s Powerful Women Programmers](http://dcfemtech.github.io/dcftawards.html)
- Moved all of my sites over to Digital Ocean and learned a bit about servers
- Bought a PS4 and got back into playing video games
- Organized a [hackathon](http://blog.allypalanzi.com/hackathon)
- Made this blog (that I don’t use enough)
- Had a blast at [Audio Hackathon](http://audiohackathon.com/)
- Promoted to Senior Front-end Engineer
- Helped organize several events for [Vox Product](http://product.voxmedia.com/events)
- Kicked ass at work in general
- Was the Maid of Honor in my best friends’s wedding (!!!) which included:
    - Designing bridal shower invites / [wedding invites](https://dribbble.com/shots/2146343-dine-dance) / lots of wedding collateral
    - Planning a pretty big bridal shower for a bunch of strangers
    - Giving a speech and sobbing in front over 150 people
- Won [Comedey Hack Day DC](http://www.comedyhackday.org/dc-2015/)
- Led a discussion at [SassConf](http://sassconf.com/)
- Traveled a bit! (Too much for work, not enough for me)

It was an exhausting and crazy year! I’m extremely introverted, anxious, and overall terrified most of the time and I can’t believe I pushed thorough all of that to accomplish all that I did. Starting to teach and putting myself out there was a huge struggle but I’m really proud of what it has done for me. 2015 was my year of personal and professional growth. I’m really looking forward to building upon that next year, and hoping to have some time to focus on more of my goals, which include:

- Spend more becoming a better programmer
- Make more things! Ship more things!
- Read more (not code related) books
- Call my parents more
- Go on a relaxing vacation
- Start another meetup (more to come later!!)
- Start going to other meetups again
- Write more! Write technical things!

See y’all in 2016, it's been fun.
