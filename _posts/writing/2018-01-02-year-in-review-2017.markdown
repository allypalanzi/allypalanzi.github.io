Hi hello happy 2018! I just got back to work after a relaxing week off where I watched every episode of Star Wars and barely left the house. I feel very rested and excited for 2018.

Early 2017 was rough for me. As for many people, the political climate and news cycle were incredibly draining. I did some small things: continued donating as much as I could afford to organizations I care about, went to protests, fought with family members over the internet, listened and consumed media from marginalized people. Between this and feeling pretty burnt out in my job, I decided to search for something new, a job in civic tech so that I could try to use my skills to help improve government from the inside. This was probably the biggest professional thing for me in 2017, but I'm pretty excited about some of the other things I did:

**Tech / Community:**

- Went to 0 conferences üòè
- Was a TechBridge Role Model
- Launched the new [DCFemTech](http://www.dcfemtech.com) website
- Helped organize, design, and run the [DCFemTech Awards](https://dcfemtech.github.io/awards), where we had over 500 attendees
- Launched a lot of [new homepages](/verge.html) for Vox Media properties
- Contributed to HealthCare.gov and supported our smoothest Open Enrollment
- Learned a legacy codebase, became the tech lead, and am now contributing to the future of HealthCare.gov ü§û
- Learned all sorts of things I had never done before and wrote a lot of JavaScript (this has been my goal in every single year in review)
- Moved up a level at work üéâ
- Spoke at the CodePen DC meetup

**Life:**

- Focused on fitness. Got even more into Muay Thai and started Jiu Jitsu recently üò≥
- My brother & his wife had a baby and now I'm an aunt!
- I started bullet journaling (but also stopped, going to start again...)
- Traveled! NYC, Madrid, New Orleans, Denver, and Santiago
- I read a lot more, but not enough. My favorite books this year were Hunger and The Girls.
- Played some good good video games & board games. Favorites: Breath of the Wild and Mario Odyssey (The Switch is the best, y'all), and Scythe
- Celebrated 4 years with my partner ‚ù§Ô∏è

**2018 Goals**

- Put more of myself back into DCFemTech
- Cook more
- Start journaling again
- Mentor and volunteer
- See and call my family more
- Design and/or build something for fun 
- Read at least one book a month
- Write at least one thing, published here or anywhere

üéâ Happy 2018! üéâ
