Femsplain is a website that publishes content by creators who identify as women. Their goal is to "highlight all the amazing diversity of women on the Internet who might not have another outlet to share their experiences." Femsplainâ€™s Kickstarter was recently funded (!) and they want to empower women by not only featuring their contributors' stories on the site, but also providing learning opportunities for women by hosting various workshops in safe spaces.
