title:  "HealthCare.Gov ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸"
subtitle: "In 2017 we began to completely rebuild the HealthCare.Gov application experience that currently enables 30+ million Americans access to healthcare. Previously, the application was split where 80% of users would use the simplified version of the application that our team maintained, while the rest of users still go through a classic application with poor user experience. We've been working to completely replace the two separate applications entirely, focusing on user-centered design and thinking broadly about how to build better software to improve access to social safety net services."
