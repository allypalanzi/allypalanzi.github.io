#### The Project
In early 2014, we embarked on a project to unify the 8 Vox Media brands and 300+ websites onto one core platform. We called this project **Unison**. Previously, our sites all shared core back-end functionality, but we had 8 completely separate front-end codebases. As we began adding brands to our platform, we realized this was absolutely not scalable.

This was a chance to start fresh! After years of building off an existing platform, we were able to start over and rethink how we do front-end development at Vox Media. We stared small: building a baseline of what a Vox Media website would be, and built in functionality to "theme" our sites, so brands could easily have a different set of styles (colors, typography, etc).

*To theme our sites, we have a modal appear over the page for designers to adjust styles.*

Currently, you can see the culmination of all of this work on <a href="http://curbed.com">Curbed</a>, <a href="http://recode.net">Recode</a>, <a href="http://racked.com">Racked</a>, <a href="http://voxmedia.com">Vox Media</a>, <a href="http://product.voxmedia.com">Vox Product Blog</a> and any Vox Media brand's article pages.

*<a href="http://curbed.com">Curbed</a> was the first site we built onto this new platform.*

As a senior front-end engineer on this team, in addition to building out the product, I've spent a lot of time writing documentation, influencing front-end architecture, and making product decisions.
