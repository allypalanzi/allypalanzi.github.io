#### Role
Concept, Website Development

#### The Project

In 2014, a group of Vox Product teammates thought it would be fun to host a design battle with folks from other companies in DC Tech at our office. We wanted to use this as a way to get more involved within the community, while also having a good time. We've now hosted two successful years of Pixel Punch. Along with organizing the entire event each year, we also create a design system to go along with it.

On the tech side, we use Middleman, a static site generator, and host using GitHub pages. I wanted to use a simple setup not only because it's a simple static web page, but because I had the opportunity to work with designers who don't always get a chance to code and I wanted them to be able to feel confident contributing to the site while also learning something we use day-to-day at Vox Media.
