## I'm Ally Palanzi.

Currently, I'm a front-end engineer with Vox Media. I have a passion for code and an eye for design. I'm obsessed with JavaScript, Sass, architecting systems, and learning all things development.

This blog is very much a work in progress, I'm new to writing and so I'm building it as I go. Please let me know if you see any [issues](http://www.github.com/allypalanzi/allypalanzi.github.io).
