I'm a senior front-end engineer at Vox Media where I help build internet websites. I also [teach, organize events, and speak](/events) often. I am not good at writing bios, but I am pretty okay at writing code. Currently: JavaScript, Sass, Ruby/Rails and learning all of the things.

This blog is a work in progress. I'm building it as I go! Please let me know if you see any [issues](http://www.github.com/allypalanzi/allypalanzi.github.io/issues).
